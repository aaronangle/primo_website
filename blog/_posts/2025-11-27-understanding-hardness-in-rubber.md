Selecting the correct **rubber hardness**, or _durometer_, is one of the most important decisions in designing a rubber part. Whether you’re developing a seal, suspension bushing, vibration isolator, or molded gasket, the hardness of the elastomer affects how the part compresses, seals, flexes, absorbs vibration, and ultimately survives long-term use.

This guide from **Primo Rubber Co.** breaks down what Shore A hardness is, how it’s measured, how it affects performance, and how to choose the right durometer for your application.

## What Is Rubber Hardness (Shore A)?

Rubber hardness is measured using the **Shore A scale**, which ranges approximately from:

- **0 Shore A** — very soft, gel-like
- **20–40 Shore A** — soft, flexible rubber
- **50–70 Shore A** — medium hardness (typical for many seals, gaskets, bushings)
- **80–95 Shore A** — very firm, rigid elastomers

The test uses a device called a **durometer** that presses a probe (an indenter) into the rubber surface under a standardized force. The depth of the indentation determines the hardness value.

## Why Durometer Matters

Rubber hardness directly affects:

### **1. Compression and Sealing Performance**

Soft rubber (20–50 Shore A) seals easily but can extrude or deform under pressure.  
Hard rubber (70–90 Shore A) resists deformation but requires more force to compress.

### **2. Vibration and Shock Isolation**

Lower durometers absorb more vibration.  
Higher durometers transmit more vibration but provide greater control and precision.

### **3. Abrasion and Durability**

Harder compounds often resist abrasion better, but some soft rubbers (like natural rubber) are also highly abrasion-resistant depending on the formulation.

### **4. Assembly and Fit**

Soft rubber conforms to surface irregularities.  
Hard rubber maintains geometry and tight tolerances better.

## How Durometer Is Tested

Shore A hardness testing follows **ASTM D2240**. Key details include:

- A spring-loaded indenter presses into the rubber
- The test is done quickly to avoid creep behavior
- Parts should be at standard temperature and thickness
- Multiple readings are typically averaged

Note that **thin parts** or **complex geometries** can produce misleading readings because they may flex during testing.

## Typical Durometer Ranges by Application

Here are general guidelines; actual needs depend on geometry, compression, and loading.

### **20–40 Shore A**

- Soft gaskets
- Conformal seals
- Medical device membranes
- Flexible diaphragms

### **50–60 Shore A**

- General-purpose seals
- Electrical enclosures
- Automotive weatherstripping
- Pump seals

### **65–75 Shore A**

- Suspension bushings
- Industrial mounts
- Valve seals
- Rubber rollers

### **80–95 Shore A**

- Heavy-duty isolators
- High-pressure seals
- Structural bumpers
- Hard wheels or rollers

## How to Choose the Right Durometer

Here are the most important factors to consider:

### **1. What forces will the part experience?**

Higher forces may require a harder rubber to avoid permanent deformation.

### **2. How much compression or deflection is acceptable?**

Soft rubbers compress easily; hard rubbers require more load.

### **3. Is vibration isolation important?**

Go softer for greater damping, unless precision is needed.

### **4. Will the part face abrasion or wear?**

Harder rubbers often resist abrasion better, but not always—compound choice matters.

### **5. What tolerances are required?**

Harder rubbers can hold tighter dimensional tolerances.

### **6. Is chemical resistance a major factor?**

Hardness alone doesn’t determine chemical resistance; material type matters too.

### **7. What is the part thickness?**

Thin parts behave “softer” during assembly; you may need a higher durometer to compensate.

## Additional Considerations

### **Durometer Drift Over Time**

Rubber tends to harden slightly as it ages due to:

- Heat exposure
- Oxidation
- UV and ozone
- Chemical exposure

Compounds can be formulated to slow this effect.

### **Use of Dual-Durometer Designs**

Parts can be molded with two hardness levels:

- Soft exterior for compliance
- Hard interior for structural support

This is common in suspension bushings and vibration mounts.

## Summary: Picking the Right Hardness

| Requirement                           | Recommended Durometer |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Soft seal / easy compression          | 30–50 Shore A         |
| General-purpose seal                  | 50–60 Shore A         |
| Controlled movement (bushings/mounts) | 65–75 Shore A         |
| High precision or structural load     | 80–95 Shore A         |
