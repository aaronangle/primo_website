Rubber parts are often chosen for their flexibility and resilience, but even the toughest compounds degrade over time when exposed to extreme environments. Understanding how **temperature**, **chemical exposure**, and **UV radiation** affect rubber longevity can help you design parts that perform reliably for years instead of months.

Below, we’ll explore how each factor influences performance — and what you can do to extend the life of your rubber products.

## Temperature: The Hidden Stress on Rubber

Temperature extremes are one of the biggest challenges in rubber performance. As heat increases, rubber can lose elasticity, soften, and even start to **thermally degrade**. In cold temperatures, it becomes brittle and prone to cracking.

Each rubber compound has its own **service temperature range**:

- **EPDM:** Excellent at high temperatures (up to ~300°F) and resistant to heat aging.
- **Nitrile (Buna-N):** Performs well in oils and fuels but has a lower upper limit (around 250°F).
- **Silicone:** Exceptional thermal stability from -75°F to +450°F, ideal for extreme conditions.

Overheating or thermal cycling can also accelerate **compression set**, causing seals or gaskets to lose their ability to maintain pressure over time.

## Chemicals: Attack from the Inside Out

Chemical exposure can break down rubber at the molecular level. Certain oils, fuels, and solvents can swell the rubber, while oxidizers or acids can cause it to harden or crack.

Here’s how common materials react:

- **Nitrile** resists petroleum oils and fuels, making it perfect for automotive and industrial use.
- **EPDM** is excellent against water, steam, and many polar chemicals but breaks down in oil-based fluids.
- **Fluoroelastomers (like Viton)** are highly resistant to aggressive chemicals, but come at a higher cost.

If your part operates in contact with lubricants, cleaning agents, or process fluids, choosing the right compound is crucial to avoid swelling, softening, or embrittlement.

## UV and Ozone: The Silent Degraders

Outdoor environments introduce another challenge: **UV radiation and ozone**. Both can cause surface cracking, discoloration, and loss of elasticity. These effects are often subtle at first but accelerate over time, especially in parts exposed to sunlight or electrical discharge.

- **EPDM** offers excellent resistance to ozone and UV, making it ideal for outdoor use.
- **Silicone** also performs well in sunlight and high-ozone environments.
- **Nitrile**, however, tends to degrade quickly under UV exposure without protective additives or coatings.

To improve longevity outdoors, manufacturers often add **anti-ozonants, stabilizers, or protective coatings** to slow down surface degradation.

## Designing for Longevity

To ensure your rubber parts last:

1. **Match the material to the environment.** Consider temperature range, chemical exposure, and outdoor conditions.
2. **Avoid overstressing parts.** Mechanical strain accelerates cracking and fatigue.
3. **Use protective finishes or housing designs** that limit UV and ozone exposure.
4. **Work with an experienced manufacturer** who understands how to balance material properties with real-world conditions.
