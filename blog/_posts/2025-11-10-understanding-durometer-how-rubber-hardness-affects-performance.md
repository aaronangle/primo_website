When designing custom rubber parts, **durometer** is one of the most important — and often overlooked — properties to get right. The durometer of a rubber compound determines how soft or hard it feels, how it compresses, and how it performs under load.

Choosing the wrong hardness can lead to seal failures, poor vibration control, or parts that simply don’t fit as intended. In this post, we’ll break down what durometer means, how it’s measured, and how it affects the performance of your rubber components.

## What Is Durometer?

**Durometer** is a measure of a material’s hardness — specifically, its resistance to indentation. It’s usually measured on the **Shore hardness scale**, which was developed to evaluate the hardness of elastomers and plastics.

For most rubber materials, the **Shore A scale** is used. This scale ranges from:

- **0 Shore A** — extremely soft and flexible (like a rubber band)
- **100 Shore A** — very hard and rigid (similar to a shopping cart wheel)

The measurement is taken using a **durometer gauge**, which presses a small indenter into the material’s surface under a standardized force. The depth of indentation determines the hardness reading.

## Why Durometer Matters

Rubber hardness plays a direct role in how a part performs under pressure, heat, and motion. A seal that’s too soft may compress too much and leak; one that’s too hard may fail to conform to its mating surface.

Here’s how durometer impacts key performance areas:

| Property                      | Soft Rubber (Lower Durometer)     | Hard Rubber (Higher Durometer)    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Compression & Flexibility** | More flexible and easily deformed | Stiffer and resists compression   |
| **Vibration Damping**         | Better energy absorption          | Lower damping capacity            |
| **Abrasion Resistance**       | Lower                             | Higher                            |
| **Tensile Strength**          | Moderate                          | Generally higher                  |
| **Sealing Ability**           | Excellent for uneven surfaces     | Best for smooth, tight tolerances |

In short: **soft rubbers seal better**, while **harder rubbers last longer under load**.

## Typical Durometer Ranges by Material

Each rubber material has its own hardness range and can be formulated to meet specific performance goals:

| Material             | Typical Durometer Range (Shore A) | Common Applications                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Silicone**         | 30–80                             | Seals, gaskets, medical devices            |
| **EPDM**             | 40–90                             | Outdoor seals, automotive weatherstripping |
| **Nitrile (Buna-N)** | 40–90                             | Oil-resistant gaskets, hydraulic seals     |
| **Neoprene**         | 30–90                             | Shock mounts, industrial seals             |
| **FKM (Viton)**      | 60–95                             | High-temperature chemical-resistant seals  |

Selecting the right hardness is a balancing act between **flexibility, strength, and durability**.

## Design Considerations for Rubber Hardness

When specifying durometer for your part, consider:

1. **Compression Set Resistance** — A harder compound may resist deformation over time, but can also increase sealing pressure.
2. **Operating Environment** — Heat, chemicals, and exposure to oil can change a material’s hardness over its lifespan.
3. **Mating Surface** — Softer rubber is ideal when sealing against rough or uneven surfaces.
4. **Part Geometry** — Thicker sections can feel stiffer even at the same durometer rating, while thinner walls may require harder materials to prevent collapse.

Working with an experienced manufacturer can help you dial in the right hardness for your exact use case.

## Choosing the Right Partner

Selecting the correct durometer isn’t just about picking a number — it’s about understanding how your part will perform in the real world. The best results come from collaboration between designers, engineers, and manufacturers.
