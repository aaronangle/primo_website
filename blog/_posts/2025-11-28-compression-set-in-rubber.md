Rubber seals are expected to maintain their shape, elasticity, and sealing force for years—sometimes decades. But over time, many elastomers **permanently deform** under constant compression or temperature, leading to leaks, pressure loss, or total seal failure.

This permanent deformation is known as **compression set**, and understanding it is key to designing reliable gaskets, O-rings, bushings, and other elastomeric sealing components.

In this guide, **Primo Rubber Co.** explains what compression set is, why it occurs, how different materials compare, and what you can do to minimize it.

## What Is Compression Set?

**Compression set** is the amount of permanent deformation a rubber part retains after being compressed for a period of time under specific temperature conditions.

Formally, compression set is defined (ASTM D395) as:

> **The percentage of a rubber material’s original thickness that is not recovered after being compressed and released.**

For example:

- A seal compressed by 25% but only recovering to 15% compression afterward has a high compression set.
- A seal that nearly returns to its original size has a low compression set.

**Lower compression set = better long-term sealing performance.**

## Why Compression Set Matters

Rubber seals rely on **elastic recovery** to maintain contact pressure. If the material takes a set:

- The seal loses force against the mating surface
- Gaps form
- Leakage begins
- Pressure drops in pneumatic or hydraulic systems
- Fasteners need retightening

In safety-critical systems (medical, automotive, aerospace), compression set is a leading cause of long-term failure.

## What Causes Compression Set?

Several factors contribute to permanent deformation:

### **1. Heat Exposure**

Heat accelerates polymer relaxation and crosslink degradation.  
Higher temperatures → higher compression set.

### **2. Continuous Compression**

Rubber under constant load slowly relaxes and loses elasticity.

### **3. Chemical Swelling**

Exposure to incompatible oils, fuels, or solvents weakens the elastomer network.

### **4. Poor Material Selection**

Some rubber types naturally resist compression set better than others.

### **5. Improper Cure**

Undercured elastomers struggle to return to original shape.

### **6. Thin Cross Sections**

Thin seals have less material to recover and may set faster.

## Which Rubber Compounds Perform Best?

Here’s a general ranking from **best** to **worst** compression set performance:

### **Excellent (Low Compression Set)**

- **Silicone (VMQ / LSR)**
- **FKM (Viton®-type fluoroelastomers)**
- **EPDM**
- **HNBR**

### **Good**

- **NBR (Nitrile)**
- **Neoprene (CR)**

### **Poor**

- **Natural Rubber (NR)**
- **SBR (styrene-butadiene)**
- **Butyl rubbers under high heat**

Silicone is the standout performer at high temperatures, while EPDM is strong when exposed to weathering or steam environments.

## How to Reduce Compression Set in Your Application

### **1. Choose a Better Base Polymer**

Select rubber materials known for low compression set under your operating conditions.

### **2. Use Proper Crosslink Systems**

Peroxide curing often gives lower compression set than sulfur curing in many compounds.

### **3. Avoid Excessive Operating Temperatures**

Every 10°C temperature increase can drastically worsen compression set.

### **4. Increase Cross-Section Thickness**

Thicker seals retain more elastic recovery.

### **5. Design for Partial Compression**

Avoid compressing seals more than **20–30%** unless the geometry specifically allows it.

### **6. Use Backing Rings or Gland Supports**

These prevent extrusion and improve long-term shape retention.

### **7. Consider Dual-Durometer or Spring-Energized Designs**

A soft sealing surface backed by a stiffer core or spring maintains long-term load.

## Common Applications Where Compression Set Is Critical

- O-rings in pumps and valves
- Static gaskets in industrial machinery
- Outdoor seals exposed to heat cycling
- HVAC and refrigeration systems
- Medical device valves and septums
- High-temperature automotive components
- Electrical enclosure gaskets

In all these cases, selecting the right elastomer is critical to long-term performance.
