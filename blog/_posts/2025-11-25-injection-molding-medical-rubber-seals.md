When developing **small, precision rubber seals for medical devices**, the molding process is just as important as the compound. Choosing between **injection molding** and **transfer molding** affects part accuracy, flash levels, material waste, assembly fit, and long-term reliability.

At **Primo Rubber Co.**, we work with medical device engineers to select the optimal molding method based on geometry, tolerances, material behavior, and regulatory requirements. This guide breaks down how both processes compare — specifically for small, high-precision elastomeric seals.

## Why Medical Device Seals Require Special Consideration

Seals used in medical devices — such as valves, diaphragms, micro O-rings, duckbill valves, septums, and pump components — must meet unusually strict requirements:

- **Ultra-tight dimensional tolerances**
- **Low or near-zero flash**
- **Biocompatibility**
- **Low particulates and smooth surface finish**
- **Repeatable performance under pressure or motion**
- **Sterilization compatibility (EtO, steam, gamma, plasma)**

These demands often dictate which molding method is most suitable.

## Injection Molding for Medical Rubber Seals

Injection molding is ideal when precision and consistency are top priorities.

### How it works

Rubber is plasticized inside a heated barrel, then injected under pressure into a closed mold.

### Advantages

- **Excellent dimensional repeatability**  
  Great for micro-seals and thin-walled components.

- **Low flash due to high clamp pressure**  
  Critical for medical sealing surfaces.

- **Fast cycle times**  
  Makes it cost-effective for medium- and high-volume production.

- **Automated gating and runner trimming**  
  Reduces manual labor and contamination risk.

- **Gentle material handling**  
  Prevents pre-curing and maintains compound integrity.

### When injection molding is the better choice

- Parts require **tighter than ±0.05 mm tolerance**
- Seals have **delicate features**, micro-lips, or thin membranes
- High annual volumes
- Multi-cavity tooling is needed
- Regulatory environments require **repeatability and low particulate generation**

## Transfer Molding for Medical Rubber Seals

Transfer molding bridges the gap between compression and injection molding, allowing more control for complex geometries.

### How it works

A slug of rubber is placed in a heated pot. A plunger pushes it through channels into the cavities.

### Advantages

- **Better for complex geometries**  
  Particularly small parts with sharp internal corners or deep undercuts (when mold design permits).

- **Lower tooling cost**  
  Ideal for prototyping or lower production volumes.

- **Good material distribution control**  
  Useful for minimizing knit lines or stress marks.

- **Reduced shear vs. injection molding**  
  Helps with shear-sensitive medical elastomers like some fluorosilicones.

### When transfer molding is the better choice

- Short runs or prototyping
- Exotic materials that degrade under high shear
- Parts with complex flow paths
- Seals that don’t require ultra-tight flash control
- Situations where tooling budget is limited

## Comparing Injection vs. Transfer Molding Side-by-Side

| Factor                       | Injection Molding           | Transfer Molding             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Dimensional accuracy**     | ★★★★★                       | ★★★★☆                        |
| **Flash control**            | ★★★★★                       | ★★★☆☆                        |
| **Tooling cost**             | ★★★★☆ (higher)              | ★★☆☆☆ (lower)                |
| **Cycle time**               | ★★★★★                       | ★★★☆☆                        |
| **Suitable for micro-seals** | Yes                         | Sometimes                    |
| **Material shear**           | Medium–Low                  | Very Low                     |
| **Best for**                 | High-precision, high-volume | Complex shapes, lower volume |

## Special Material Considerations for Medical Applications

Both molding methods can work with common medical elastomers:

- **LSR (liquid silicone rubber)**
- **HCR silicone**
- **EPDM for pump seals**
- **FKM/FPM for chemical exposure**
- **Fluorosilicone**
- **Custom biocompatible compounds**

Injection molding excels for LSR micro-parts, while transfer molding is often preferred for high-consistency rubber (HCR) parts with sensitive geometries.

## How to Choose the Right Process

Ask these questions when selecting a molding method:

1. **What are the dimensional tolerance requirements?**
2. **What annual volume do you expect?**
3. **Does the part have delicate or micro-scale features?**
4. **Is flash removal unacceptable or restricted?**
5. **Is the elastomer shear-sensitive?**
6. **What is the tooling budget?**
7. **Do you need a multi-cavity setup?**

Primo Rubber Co. helps evaluate each part’s geometry, functional requirements, and regulatory environment to determine the correct molding strategy.
