In sensitive applications—automotive interiors, medical devices, aerospace cabins, electronics enclosures, and vacuum systems—**rubber off-gassing and VOC emissions** can be just as important as tensile strength or compression set.

While all elastomers can release small amounts of volatile compounds, **emission behavior varies significantly by rubber type and formulation**. Choosing the wrong material can lead to odor complaints, fogging on optical surfaces, sensor interference, or failure to meet regulatory standards.

This guide from **Primo Rubber Co.** focuses specifically on how different rubber families compare when it comes to VOC release and long-term off-gassing.

# What Causes Rubber to Off-Gas?

Emission levels depend on:

- Polymer chemistry
- Cure system (sulfur vs peroxide)
- Oil content
- Post-cure process
- Service temperature

Now let’s break down the major elastomer families.

# VOC & Off-Gassing Comparison by Rubber Type

## Silicone (VMQ / LSR)

**General emission profile:** Low (when properly post-cured)

Silicone rubber is often chosen for low-VOC applications because:

- It contains no plasticizers
- It has inherently stable polymer chains
- It performs well at high temperatures
- It can be post-cured to remove residual volatiles

However, without proper post-curing, silicone can release:

- Residual siloxanes
- Cure byproducts

### Best for:

- Medical devices
- Electronics
- Optical assemblies
- Automotive interiors
- Sealed enclosures

**Key tip:** Always specify _post-cured silicone_ for low-emission applications.

---

## EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer)

**General emission profile:** Low to Moderate (formulation dependent)

EPDM is widely used in automotive interiors and outdoor seals because:

- It has good chemical stability
- It does not require heavy plasticization
- It resists ozone and UV

However, VOC performance depends heavily on:

- Oil extension level
- Cure chemistry
- Additive package

Low-VOC EPDM compounds are commonly available for interior automotive use.

### Best for:

- Automotive weatherstripping
- HVAC seals
- Outdoor enclosures
- Water-contact applications

---

## NBR (Nitrile Rubber)

**General emission profile:** Moderate to High

NBR often contains:

- Processing oils
- Plasticizers
- Sulfur cure residues

Because nitrile is commonly oil-extended, it may produce noticeable odor or volatile emissions—especially in confined spaces.

Hydrogenated NBR (HNBR) performs somewhat better but can still emit depending on formulation.

### Best for:

- Industrial environments
- Oil and fuel systems (where VOC release is less critical)

Not typically ideal for odor-sensitive interior environments without special formulation.

---

## FKM (Fluoroelastomer)

**General emission profile:** Very Low (after proper cure)

FKM materials are highly stable and chemically resistant. They:

- Have low volatile content
- Resist high temperatures
- Perform well in vacuum environments

Because of their stability, FKM elastomers are often used in:

- Aerospace
- Fuel systems
- High-temp industrial sealing

### Best for:

- Vacuum systems
- Aerospace cabins
- High-temperature electronics
- Chemical processing

They are typically more expensive but offer excellent emission control.

---

## Butyl Rubber (IIR)

**General emission profile:** Very Low Permeability, Low to Moderate VOC (formulation dependent)

Butyl rubber is unique because it has:

- Extremely low gas permeability
- Excellent sealing capability
- Strong resistance to air diffusion

This makes it ideal for applications where **gas containment is critical**.

However, butyl can contain processing oils and additives that contribute to VOC emissions if not properly formulated.

### Advantages:

- Low gas transmission
- Good chemical resistance
- Strong damping properties

### Best for:

- Air retention systems
- Vacuum seals
- Pharmaceutical stoppers
- Tire inner liners
- Gas barrier components

When compounded for low-VOC performance, butyl rubber can be a strong candidate for sealed-system applications.

---

## Natural Rubber (NR)

**General emission profile:** Moderate to High

Natural rubber can produce:

- Noticeable odor
- Organic volatiles from natural proteins
- Oxidative byproducts over time

It also requires stabilizers to prevent degradation, which may contribute to emissions.

### Best for:

- Mechanical applications where emissions are not critical
- Abrasion-heavy environments

Generally not recommended for sensitive, low-emission systems.

# Quick Comparison Table

| Rubber Type           | Typical VOC Level | Best For Low Emissions?       |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Silicone (post-cured) | Low               | Yes                           |
| FKM                   | Very Low          | Yes                           |
| EPDM (low-VOC grade)  | Low–Moderate      | Yes                           |
| Butyl (IIR)           | Low–Moderate      | Yes (with proper formulation) |
| HNBR                  | Moderate          | Sometimes                     |
| NBR                   | Moderate–High     | Not ideal                     |
| Natural Rubber        | Moderate–High     | No                            |

# Factors That Matter More Than Polymer Choice

Even more important than the base elastomer:

- Oil extension level
- Cure chemistry
- Post-cure process
- Additive selection
- Mold temperature control
- Proper aging before shipment

A poorly formulated silicone can emit more VOCs than a well-optimized EPDM.

---

# When Should You Worry About Off-Gassing?

You should evaluate emissions if your rubber part will be used in:

- Enclosed cabins
- Medical environments
- Optical or lens assemblies
- Sensor housings
- Vacuum systems
- Battery enclosures
- Automotive interiors
- Semiconductor equipment

Early testing and specification prevents expensive redesigns later.
