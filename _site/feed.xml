A well-designed mold ensures consistent dimensions, smooth surface finishes, and efficient production. Poor tooling design, on the other hand, can lead to flash, voids, uneven curing, or premature wear. Understanding how tooling affects part quality is key to achieving reliable, high-performance results.</p>

<h2 id="precision-in-mold-cavities">Precision in Mold Cavities</h2>

<p>The mold cavity defines the exact shape of your finished part. Even a tiny dimensional error can create big downstream issues. Tolerances in the thousandths of an inch matter — especially for seals, grommets, or other precision components. Properly machined cavities ensure your parts stay consistent across thousands of molding cycles.</p>

<h2 id="gate-and-runner-design">Gate and Runner Design</h2>

<p>The way molten rubber enters the mold determines how evenly it flows and cures. Poor gate placement can cause <strong>air traps</strong>, <strong>weld lines</strong>, or <strong>uneven fill</strong>, leading to cosmetic flaws or weak areas. Optimized gate and runner design ensures the rubber reaches every area of the mold evenly, reducing waste and improving cycle time.</p>

<h2 id="venting-and-air-management">Venting and Air Management</h2>

<p>Trapped air is one of the most common causes of defects in molded rubber parts. Well-designed venting channels allow gases to escape during injection and curing, preventing <strong>burn marks</strong>, <strong>voids</strong>, and <strong>incomplete fills</strong>. This is especially critical for parts with thin walls or intricate shapes.</p>

<h2 id="temperature-control">Temperature Control</h2>

<p>Rubber molding depends on precise heating and curing. Uneven mold temperatures can cause inconsistent hardness, shrinkage, or undercured regions. Smart heating and cooling channels within the mold help maintain stable process conditions — ensuring repeatable, high-quality results.</p>

<h2 id="material-shrinkage-compensation">Material Shrinkage Compensation</h2>

<p>Each rubber compound behaves differently during cooling and curing. Tooling must account for <strong>material shrinkage rates</strong> so that finished parts meet dimensional specs. Experienced mold designers balance these allowances based on the rubber formulation and part geometry.</p>

<h2 id="durability-and-maintenance">Durability and Maintenance</h2>

<p>Tooling materials and finishes have a direct impact on part quality and production uptime. Hardened steels and surface coatings reduce wear from abrasive compounds and extend mold life. Easy-to-clean vents and replaceable inserts help maintain consistent quality over long production runs.</p>

Not all rubber compounds are created equal — exposure to oils and hydrocarbons can cause swelling, softening, or complete material failure if the wrong compound is used.</p>

<p>In this guide, we’ll cover the best <strong>oil-resistant rubber materials</strong>, their advantages, and how to choose the right one for your application.</p>

<h2 id="why-oil-resistance-matters">Why Oil Resistance Matters</h2>

<p>Oil exposure attacks rubber from the inside out. Petroleum-based fluids can dissolve or displace plasticizers in the compound, leading to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Swelling and loss of shape</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Reduced tensile strength</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Surface cracking or tackiness</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Permanent deformation or leaks</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In dynamic seals, these effects cause premature wear and loss of sealing pressure — which can mean downtime, contamination, or system failure. Choosing the right rubber compound helps prevent these costly problems.</p>

<h2 id="nitrile-rubber-buna-n">Nitrile Rubber (Buna-N)</h2>

<p><strong>Nitrile rubber (NBR)</strong> is the most widely used oil-resistant material. It performs exceptionally well in contact with petroleum oils, fuels, greases, and many hydraulic fluids.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Excellent resistance to oil and fuel</li>
  <li>Good abrasion and tear resistance</li>
  <li>Available in a wide hardness range</li>
  <li>Cost-effective for large production runs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Poor resistance to ozone and UV</li>
  <li>Not ideal for extreme temperatures (typically -30°F to +250°F)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong><br />
Automotive seals, fuel hoses, oil-resistant grommets, and industrial gaskets.</p>

<h2 id="hydrogenated-nitrile-hnbr">Hydrogenated Nitrile (HNBR)</h2>

<p><strong>HNBR</strong> is a modified version of Nitrile that improves heat, ozone, and aging resistance while maintaining strong oil resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Higher temperature stability (up to 300°F)</li>
  <li>Excellent resistance to oils and fuels</li>
  <li>Improved mechanical strength and longevity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Higher cost than standard Nitrile</li>
  <li>Slightly reduced flexibility at low temperatures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>

<p>High-performance automotive seals, oilfield components, and industrial machinery exposed to heat and oil.</p>

<h2 id="fluoroelastomers-viton--fkm">Fluoroelastomers (Viton® / FKM)</h2>

<p><strong>Viton</strong> and other <strong>fluoroelastomers (FKM)</strong> offer the ultimate resistance to oils, fuels, and aggressive chemicals. They are ideal for extreme environments where both heat and chemical exposure are concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Excellent resistance to fuels, oils, and solvents</li>
  <li>Handles continuous temperatures up to 400°F</li>
  <li>Exceptional chemical resistance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Higher material cost</li>
  <li>Limited low-temperature flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>

<p>Aerospace seals, high-performance automotive systems, and industrial sealing in harsh chemical environments.</p>

<h2 id="other-oil-resistant-options">Other Oil-Resistant Options</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Neoprene:</strong> Good for general-purpose oil and fuel resistance, though not as strong as Nitrile or Viton.</li>
  <li><strong>Polyacrylate (ACM):</strong> Used in automotive transmission and engine seals for high-temperature oil resistance.</li>
  <li><strong>EPDM:</strong> Poor oil resistance — best avoided in petroleum-based environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="selecting-the-right-compound">Selecting the Right Compound</h2>

<p>When choosing an oil-resistant rubber, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Temperature range</strong> of operation</li>
  <li><strong>Type of oil or fuel</strong> (synthetic, mineral, bio-based, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure and mechanical stress</strong> on the part</li>
  <li><strong>Exposure to ozone, UV, or outdoor conditions</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Testing in real-world conditions is always recommended before full production.</p>

When these components fail, the result can be costly downtime, safety hazards, and even product recalls. That’s why <strong>improving the durability</strong> of industrial rubber seals and gaskets is one of the smartest investments any manufacturer can make.</p>

<p>At <strong>Primo Rubber Co.</strong>, we’ve seen firsthand how small design or material changes can dramatically extend part life. In this post, we’ll cover the key factors that influence seal and gasket performance — and how to make your components last longer in tough environments.</p>

<h2 id="1-choose-the-right-rubber-material">1. Choose the Right Rubber Material</h2>

<p>Not all rubber is created equal. The first step to improving durability is matching the rubber compound to its operating environment. Common material choices include:</p>

      <td>General-purpose gaskets and mounts</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Selecting the right compound helps prevent swelling, cracking, or hardening over time — the leading causes of seal failure.</p>

<h2 id="2-optimize-the-seal-design">2. Optimize the Seal Design</h2>

<p>Durability often comes down to design. A well-designed seal distributes stress evenly, maintains compression, and prevents leaks even under fluctuating pressures. Consider these key design principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proper compression ratio:</strong> Too much compression causes stress and deformation; too little leads to leaks.</li>
  <li><strong>Smooth sealing surfaces:</strong> Sharp edges or uneven finishes increase wear.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid thin cross-sections:</strong> Thin sections are prone to tearing and distortion.</li>
  <li><strong>Support against extrusion:</strong> In high-pressure applications, use backup rings or harder durometer rubbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even small tweaks in geometry can add years of life to a seal.</p>

<h2 id="3-control-environmental-exposure">3. Control Environmental Exposure</h2>

<p>Heat, UV light, ozone, and chemicals all accelerate rubber degradation. Protect your seals by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shielding from direct sunlight</strong> when possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Choosing ozone-resistant materials</strong> like EPDM or silicone.</li>
  <li><strong>Using compatible lubricants</strong> — avoid petroleum-based greases with non-oil-resistant compounds.</li>
  <li><strong>Considering coatings or additives</strong> that enhance resistance to harsh environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>These preventative measures are especially important for seals exposed to outdoor conditions or fluctuating temperatures.</p>

<h2 id="4-ensure-proper-installation-and-compression">4. Ensure Proper Installation and Compression</h2>

<p>Many gasket failures occur <strong>not from bad materials</strong>, but from <strong>improper installation</strong>. Over-tightening bolts, using the wrong gasket thickness, or misaligning parts can crush or tear the seal before it ever goes into service. Always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use torque specifications recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
  <li>Confirm uniform compression across the sealing surface.</li>
  <li>Inspect for damage or contamination before assembly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking the time to install correctly pays off with longer-lasting, more reliable performance.</p>

Each material has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the environment, temperature, and chemical exposure. Among the most common options are <strong>EPDM</strong>, <strong>Nitrile (Buna-N)</strong>, and <strong>Silicone</strong>. Here’s how they compare — and how to choose the right one for your application.</p>

<h2 id="epdm-ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer">EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer)</h2>

<p><strong>EPDM</strong> is known for its excellent resistance to <strong>weathering, ozone, water, and UV exposure</strong>. It performs exceptionally well outdoors and in applications exposed to the elements. It also resists many polar substances, including alcohols, brake fluids, and phosphate esters.</p>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Outdoor seals and gaskets</li>
  <li>HVAC components</li>
  <li>Automotive weatherstripping</li>
  <li>Water system parts and hoses</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>

<p>EPDM doesn’t handle petroleum oils or hydrocarbons well. For applications involving fuel, lubricants, or oil contact, another material (like Nitrile) is a better fit.</p>

<h2 id="nitrile-buna-n">Nitrile (Buna-N)</h2>

<p><strong>Nitrile rubber</strong> is the go-to choice for <strong>oil-resistant applications</strong>. It has excellent resistance to fuels, lubricants, and many hydraulic fluids, making it a popular choice in industrial and automotive environments. It also offers good tensile strength and abrasion resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fuel and oil seals</li>
  <li>Industrial hoses and grommets</li>
  <li>Automotive gaskets and O-rings</li>
  <li>Hydraulic and pneumatic seals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>

<p>Nitrile doesn’t perform as well in extreme weather or UV exposure. It can also stiffen in very cold temperatures, so outdoor flexibility can be an issue in freezing environments.</p>

<h2 id="silicone">Silicone</h2>

<p><strong>Silicone rubber</strong> excels in <strong>temperature stability</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong> across a wide range — typically from -75°F to +450°F. It’s also highly inert, non-reactive, and available in FDA-approved grades, making it a favorite in <strong>medical, food, and electronics</strong> applications. Silicone maintains softness and elasticity even under heat and compression.</p>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Food-grade and medical products</li>
  <li>High-temperature seals and gaskets</li>
  <li>Electronics and lighting components</li>
  <li>Environments requiring chemical or ozone resistance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>

<p>Silicone is not as strong as Nitrile or EPDM in tear or abrasion resistance, and it can be more costly. It’s also less resistant to fuels and oils.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-rubber-for-your-project">Choosing the Right Rubber for Your Project</h2>

<p>Selecting the right compound means understanding your environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Exposure to oil or fuel?</strong> → Go with Nitrile.</li>
  <li><strong>Outdoor or weather-exposed?</strong> → Choose EPDM.</li>
  <li><strong>High temperature or FDA compliance?</strong> → Silicone is ideal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each material has trade-offs, and the best choice often depends on balancing performance, durability, and cost.</p>

Understanding how <strong>temperature</strong>, <strong>chemical exposure</strong>, and <strong>UV radiation</strong> affect rubber longevity can help you design parts that perform reliably for years instead of months.</p>

<p>Below, we’ll explore how each factor influences performance — and what you can do to extend the life of your rubber products.</p>

<h2 id="temperature-the-hidden-stress-on-rubber">Temperature: The Hidden Stress on Rubber</h2>

<p>Temperature extremes are one of the biggest challenges in rubber performance. As heat increases, rubber can lose elasticity, soften, and even start to <strong>thermally degrade</strong>. In cold temperatures, it becomes brittle and prone to cracking.</p>

<p>Each rubber compound has its own <strong>service temperature range</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>EPDM:</strong> Excellent at high temperatures (up to ~300°F) and resistant to heat aging.</li>
  <li><strong>Nitrile (Buna-N):</strong> Performs well in oils and fuels but has a lower upper limit (around 250°F).</li>
  <li><strong>Silicone:</strong> Exceptional thermal stability from -75°F to +450°F, ideal for extreme conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overheating or thermal cycling can also accelerate <strong>compression set</strong>, causing seals or gaskets to lose their ability to maintain pressure over time.</p>

<h2 id="chemicals-attack-from-the-inside-out">Chemicals: Attack from the Inside Out</h2>

<p>Chemical exposure can break down rubber at the molecular level. Certain oils, fuels, and solvents can swell the rubber, while oxidizers or acids can cause it to harden or crack.</p>

<p>Here’s how common materials react:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nitrile</strong> resists petroleum oils and fuels, making it perfect for automotive and industrial use.</li>
  <li><strong>EPDM</strong> is excellent against water, steam, and many polar chemicals but breaks down in oil-based fluids.</li>
  <li><strong>Fluoroelastomers (like Viton)</strong> are highly resistant to aggressive chemicals, but come at a higher cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your part operates in contact with lubricants, cleaning agents, or process fluids, choosing the right compound is crucial to avoid swelling, softening, or embrittlement.</p>

<h2 id="uv-and-ozone-the-silent-degraders">UV and Ozone: The Silent Degraders</h2>

<p>Outdoor environments introduce another challenge: <strong>UV radiation and ozone</strong>. Both can cause surface cracking, discoloration, and loss of elasticity. These effects are often subtle at first but accelerate over time, especially in parts exposed to sunlight or electrical discharge.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>EPDM</strong> offers excellent resistance to ozone and UV, making it ideal for outdoor use.</li>
  <li><strong>Silicone</strong> also performs well in sunlight and high-ozone environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Nitrile</strong>, however, tends to degrade quickly under UV exposure without protective additives or coatings.</li>
</ul>

<p>To improve longevity outdoors, manufacturers often add <strong>anti-ozonants, stabilizers, or protective coatings</strong> to slow down surface degradation.</p>

<h2 id="designing-for-longevity">Designing for Longevity</h2>

<p>To ensure your rubber parts last:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Match the material to the environment.</strong> Consider temperature range, chemical exposure, and outdoor conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid overstressing parts.</strong> Mechanical strain accelerates cracking and fatigue.</li>
  <li><strong>Use protective finishes or housing designs</strong> that limit UV and ozone exposure.</li>
  <li><strong>Work with an experienced manufacturer</strong> who understands how to balance material properties with real-world conditions.</li>
</ol>

From engine mounts to door seals, custom-molded rubber parts are essential to comfort, safety, and performance. But designing these components for modern vehicles requires more than just choosing a flexible material — it demands attention to temperature, chemical exposure, noise reduction, and manufacturability.</p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-rubber-in-automotive-design">The Role of Rubber in Automotive Design</h2>

<p>Rubber is used throughout vehicles to absorb vibration, seal out contaminants, and handle the stress of constant motion. Common automotive rubber parts include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Weather seals</strong> around doors, trunks, and windows</li>
  <li><strong>Engine and transmission mounts</strong> that reduce vibration and noise</li>
  <li><strong>Bushings and grommets</strong> that cushion and isolate mechanical systems</li>
  <li><strong>O-rings and gaskets</strong> for fluid systems</li>
  <li><strong>Hoses and tubing</strong> for air, coolant, and fuel delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>Each component has specific performance requirements depending on where it’s used.</p>

<h2 id="key-design-factors">Key Design Factors</h2>

<h3 id="1-temperature-resistance">1. Temperature Resistance</h3>

<p>Rubber parts near engines, exhausts, or brakes must endure temperatures well above 100°C. <strong>Silicone</strong> and <strong>fluoroelastomers (FKM/Viton)</strong> perform exceptionally in high-heat environments, maintaining elasticity where standard rubbers would harden or crack.</p>

<h3 id="2-chemical-compatibility">2. Chemical Compatibility</h3>

<p>Automotive fluids — oils, fuels, coolants, and brake fluids — can degrade standard rubber compounds. <strong>Nitrile (Buna-N)</strong> and <strong>EPDM</strong> are common choices for their strong resistance to oils and glycol-based fluids, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="3-noise-vibration-and-harshness-nvh">3. Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH)</h3>

<p>Reducing NVH is a major design priority for modern vehicles, especially electric ones. Rubber bushings, gaskets, and isolators are tuned for specific hardness (durometer) to balance stiffness with vibration absorption.</p>

<h3 id="4-tight-tolerances-and-consistency">4. Tight Tolerances and Consistency</h3>

<p>Automotive OEMs demand <strong>precise dimensions</strong> and <strong>repeatable quality</strong>. Rubber injection molding allows for high accuracy and consistent results across large production runs, ensuring every part fits perfectly on the assembly line.</p>

How these parts are made varies greatly depending on the volume, complexity, material, and performance requirements. In this post, we’ll explore the full spectrum of rubber manufacturing methods, from home-scale DIY techniques to high-volume industrial production, and explain why choosing the right process is critical for quality and durability.</p>

<h2 id="1-at-home-and-diy-methods"><strong>1. At-Home and DIY Methods</strong></h2>

<p>For hobbyists, designers, or engineers creating prototypes, several techniques allow rubber parts to be made outside of an industrial environment. These methods are generally low-volume and flexible, but they often come with trade-offs in consistency, precision, and material options.</p>

<h3 id="pouring-and-casting"><strong>Pouring and Casting</strong></h3>

<p>One of the most accessible methods is pouring liquid silicone or urethane rubber into a mold. The molds themselves can be created from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>• 3D-printed PLA or resin parts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>• Hand-sculpted clay or wax forms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>• Silicone molds from a previous master part</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After the liquid rubber is poured into the mold, it is allowed to cure at room temperature or in a low-temperature oven, depending on the material.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong> include low cost, the ability to quickly iterate designs, and minimal equipment requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong> include uneven curing, limited part size, and surface imperfections if the mold isn’t perfectly clean or vented.</p>

<h3 id="compression-molding-at-small-scale"><strong>Compression Molding at Small Scale</strong></h3>

<p>Even outside industrial settings, small manual presses can be used to compress pre-formed sheets or pellets of uncured rubber into molds. Heat and pressure trigger vulcanization (curing) of the rubber. This method is particularly useful for simple shapes or small runs where precision is less critical.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong> include uneven wall thickness and higher scrap rates if the press isn’t carefully monitored.</p>

<h3 id="slush-molding"><strong>Slush Molding</strong></h3>

<p>Slush molding allows for hollow or thin-walled parts by pouring liquid rubber into a mold, rotating it to coat the walls, and draining excess material before curing. This technique is common for small hollow prototypes or flexible sleeves. It requires some skill to achieve even wall thickness and consistent curing but can produce lightweight, flexible parts for testing or demonstration.</p>

<h2 id="2-small-scale-or-prototype-production"><strong>2. Small-Scale or Prototype Production</strong></h2>

<p>Once you move beyond simple home experimentation, small-scale production methods offer better consistency, repeatability, and material options. These processes are often used for prototyping, small-batch runs, or specialty applications.</p>

<h3 id="compression-molding"><strong>Compression Molding</strong></h3>

<p>Compression molding is widely used in small-scale industrial applications. Pre-measured “preforms” of uncured rubber are placed into heated molds. When the mold closes and pressure is applied, the rubber flows to fill the cavity and cures. It is a relatively simple method that works well for geometrically simple parts, gaskets, or small mechanical components.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good for medium-volume production, relatively low tooling cost.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Longer cycle times than injection molding, less suitable for intricate designs, potential for flash if mold alignment isn’t perfect.</p>

<h3 id="transfer-molding"><strong>Transfer Molding</strong></h3>

<p>Transfer molding improves upon compression molding by forcing rubber from a chamber into mold cavities through channels called runners. This allows for more complex shapes and reduces the likelihood of trapped air. Transfer molding can produce multi-cavity molds with better control over material flow.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> More precise than compression molding, can handle moderately complex shapes.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Still slower than injection molding, slightly higher tooling complexity.</p>

<h3 id="vacuum-casting"><strong>Vacuum Casting</strong></h3>

<p>For silicone and other liquid rubbers, vacuum casting is used to remove air bubbles and ensure a smooth surface finish. The uncured material is placed under vacuum to degas before being poured into a mold. This process is ideal for functional prototypes where mechanical performance and surface quality are important.</p>

<h2 id="3-industrial-scale-production"><strong>3. Industrial-Scale Production</strong></h2>

<p>For high-volume, precision, and performance-critical applications, industrial processes dominate. These methods are used by companies producing millions of parts per year.</p>

<h3 id="injection-molding"><strong>Injection Molding</strong></h3>

<p>Rubber injection molding is the most common method for large-scale production of complex parts. Uncured rubber is heated to a workable viscosity and injected into a closed mold under high pressure. The rubber cures inside the mold, and the part is ejected once fully vulcanized.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High precision and repeatability</strong> – critical for tight tolerances or multi-cavity molds.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast cycle times</strong> – ideal for medium to high-volume production.</li>
  <li><strong>Material efficiency</strong> – minimal scrap compared to compression molding.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex geometries</strong> – can mold intricate shapes, thin walls, and multiple features in one shot.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Mold design is critical, including gate locations, venting, and draft angles. Material selection affects shrinkage, hardness, and final properties.</p>

<h3 id="extrusion"><strong>Extrusion</strong></h3>

<p>Extrusion is used for continuous profiles such as tubing, hoses, or seals. Rubber is forced through a shaped die and then vulcanized in a continuous curing process. Extrusion excels at creating long, uniform parts, and wall thickness and dimensional control are key for performance.</p>

<h3 id="calendaring"><strong>Calendaring</strong></h3>

<p>Calendaring produces flat sheets of rubber with consistent thickness and surface finish. These sheets are often die-cut or molded into final parts. While less flexible for complex shapes, calendaring is highly efficient for producing sheets used in seals, gaskets, or laminated assemblies.</p>

<h3 id="automated-post-processing"><strong>Automated Post-Processing</strong></h3>

<p>Modern factories often integrate trimming, inspection, and testing into production lines. Automated processes ensure that each part meets strict tolerances, dimensional stability, and functional specifications.</p>

<h2 id="material-considerations-across-all-methods"><strong>Material Considerations Across All Methods</strong></h2>

<p>Whether at home or in an industrial facility, material choice affects how a part is made:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Silicone:</strong> Flexible, temperature-resistant, ideal for prototypes and FDA-compliant parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Nitrile/Buna-N:</strong> Oil-resistant, common for seals in automotive and industrial applications.</li>
  <li><strong>EPDM:</strong> Excellent weather and ozone resistance, used in outdoor applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Viton (FKM):</strong> High-temperature and chemical resistance, suitable for aerospace or chemical industries.</li>
</ul>

<p>The material determines curing requirements, viscosity, flow behavior, and post-processing needs. Experienced manufacturers can guide clients to the right material for their application.</p>
